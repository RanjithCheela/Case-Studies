Storytelling Case Study: Airbnb NYC
Imagine you are a data analyst at Airbnb. Recently, Airbnb has experienced a significant decline in revenue. With travel restrictions lifting and people starting to travel more, Airbnb wants to be fully prepared for this change.
The leadership team at Airbnb is looking for key insights based on various attributes in the dataset to boost revenue. These insights include:
* Identifying which types of hosts to acquire more and where.
* Categorizing customers based on their preferences.
* Targeting specific neighborhoods.
* Understanding the pricing ranges preferred by customers.
* Analyzing the various kinds of properties that exist with respect to customer preferences.
* Making adjustments to existing properties to make them more customer-oriented.
* Identifying the most popular localities and properties in New York currently.
* Finding ways to get unpopular properties more traction.
